# Difference of two sets A-B#

# Union of two Set AUB#
print('Union of A and B is : ', A | B)
# Intersection of two sets A&B#

# symmetric difference of A and B#
print('Symmetric difference of A and B is : ', A ^ B)
# In Symmetric difference has all elements of A and B but exclude common elements#
